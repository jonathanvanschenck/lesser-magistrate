# ![](assets/ioc-logo.png) The Lesser Magistrate
A collection of Electrical and Mechanical Schematics for the IOC Lesser Magistrate Quizzing System

Schematics, PCB Files, BOM and 3D printing files are [available here](https://github.com/jonathanvanschenck/lesser-magistrate).

## Philosophy of Design
Heretofore, bible quizzing has had a fairly high barrier to entry; whether it be complicated rulebooks, distinct cultural practices or (of relevance here) expensive supplies. This project
seeks to address that third barrier by providing a low-cost, high-performance quizzing buzzer system, which can built by a reasonably competent individual. Unlike existing systems, we need
to meet the following design requirements:

  - Low cost and easily available parts
  - Easily manufactureable without special tooling
  - Is modular in design (e.g. individual components are easily and cheaply replaceable)
  - Can support up to 15 simultaneous participants

## Build Instructions
A full list of materials (BOM) is [available here](lib/BOM.csv).

All electrical schematics are available in the `graphics` folder.

All the electrical schematic/pcb/component files are available in the `lib` folder. Interested parties should aquire a copy of [diptrace](https://diptrace.com/) to view/edit.

All 3D printable parts are available in the `3d` folder; check out [the README](3d/README.md) for details.

For help souldering and constructing the Lesser Magistrate system, a guided build playlist is [available here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-B20jy8v2o&list=PL-Vn05Kf5ezxIfupx7_Z1d6l5HKGBeLW2).

## Contributing
The Lesser Magistrate is a fully open sourced project, and as such contribution is encouraged! As such PRs are more than welcome, and we would love to hear about [any issues](https://github.com/jonathanvanschenck/lesser-magistrate/issues) you may run into. Feature requests are also encouraged -- though keep in mind features will only be included in this project if they conform to the Philosophy of Design described above. Finally, if you take this project and do something cool with it (like adding extra features not suitable to this design philosophy), we would love to hear about it so that we can add a link to your work in the section below!

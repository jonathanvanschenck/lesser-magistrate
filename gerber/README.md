# Gerber Files
In this directory are the gerber files (extension `.zip`) for the PCBs used in this project.

A gerber file is really just a zip file containing all the information necessary for a PCB manufacturer to create your PCB. Any boardhouse will know what to do with a gerber file.

Note, each file will create only a single instance of whatever it contains. So, for example, if you order "a LMM board" from the gerber file, you will get exactly 1 PCB, where a typical set requires 3. So, you will want to make sure your quantities are corrected when ordering.
